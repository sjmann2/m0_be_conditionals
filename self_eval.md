# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- **I feel good with my understanding of comparison operators, I feel like I picked them up easily enough because they're not completely foreign concepts.**
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- **Logical operators are a little more tricky. I understand them on their own and then sometimes when I'm using them in code they trip me up. In my spicy code challenge I thought I used them correctly until I tested my code and it came back incorrect. They're something I have to think through more thoroughly and test out my code to make sure I'm using them correctly.**
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- **I feel pretty confident in using if statements right now.**
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- **This lesson took me the longest of any of them so far. I estimated 1.5 hours and I'm nearing 3.5 hours. The conditional practice definitely took the majority of that time.**
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- **I feel like I need practice on logical operators the most, but the code challenge I worked on today was good practice.**
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- **No questions right now.**
